These are python versions of functions in ymaeda_tools. 
The original functions and programs were written by Dr. Y. Maeda 
of Nagoya University in the C programming language. 
During my time at the University of Tokyo I have translated a number 
of the functions into python in order to carry out Moment Tensor 
Inversion analysis on volcanic long period waveforms, as I 
basically did not understand how to write and modify C code.
