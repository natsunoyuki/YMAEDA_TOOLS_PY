These are python versions of the original seismic analysis programs written by Dr. Y. Maeda (https://www.seis.nagoya-u.ac.jp/center-e/staff/staff.html) of Nagoya University in the C programming language. During my time at the Earthquake Research Institute I translated a number of those functions into Python in order to perform Moment Tensor Inversion analysis on volcanic long period waveforms.
